Project Overview:
This project aims to predict house prices based on various features such as square footage, number of bedrooms, bathrooms, location, and other real estate-related attributes. Using machine learning models, this project explores different algorithms to achieve accurate price predictions.

Dataset
The dataset used for this project contains real estate listings and prices. The main features include:

LotArea: Total lot size in square feet.
OverallQual: Overall material and finish quality.
YearBuilt: Original construction date.
TotalBsmtSF: Total square feet of basement area.
GrLivArea: Above grade (ground) living area square feet.
FullBath: Number of full bathrooms.
GarageCars: Size of garage in car capacity.
SalePrice: The sale price of the house (target variable).
Source
The dataset used in this project is the Ames Housing Dataset available on Kaggle.

Usage
Data Preprocessing:

Run the data preprocessing script to clean and transform the data.
Execute data_preprocessing.py to handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and normalize/scale features.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Navigate to notebooks/exploratory_data_analysis.ipynb for visualizations and insights into the dataset.
Model Training:

Use the model_training.ipynb notebook to train various machine learning models (e.g., Linear Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost).
Fine-tune hyperparameters using grid search or random search.
Prediction:

After training the model, predict the house prices on the test dataset.
Run the model.py file for predictions on new data.
Models Used
Linear Regression
Random Forest Regressor
XGBoost Regressor
Performance metrics are evaluated using:

Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
R-squared (R²)
Results
The best model achieved an RMSE of XXXX on the test set. You can find more detailed model performance in the notebooks/model_training.ipynb.

Future Work
Add more features, such as location-based data, to improve model accuracy.
Experiment with other machine learning models like Gradient Boosting, LightGBM, or deep learning models.
Create a web-based user interface to input house details and predict prices in real-time.
